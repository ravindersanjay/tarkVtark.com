## **PART 1: FRONTEND HOSTING COMPARISON**

### **AWS Amplify vs CloudFront + S3**

---

## **OPTION 1: AWS Amplify** 

### **What is it?**
Managed hosting service specifically for web apps (React, Vue, Angular, Static Sites)

### **How it works:**
```
You push code to GitHub
           ↓
Amplify auto-detects
           ↓
Runs build command (npm run build)
           ↓
Deploys to CloudFront CDN
           ↓
Your app goes live automatically
```

### **Setup Process:**
```
1. Go to AWS Amplify console
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Configure build settings (pre-filled for React!)
4. Deploy!
Time: 10 minutes
```

### **Pricing:**

| Item | Amount | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Storage (dist folder) | 15GB/month | $0 (free tier) |
| Bandwidth/data transfer | 50GB/month | $0 (free tier) |
| Build minutes | 1000/month | $0 (free tier) |
| Build minutes (excess) | Per minute | $0.01/min |
| Paid domain | Annual | $12 |
| **TOTAL (free tier)** | - | **$0/month** |

**After free tier:**
```
Storage (15-100GB):      $0.023/GB/month
Bandwidth (50-500GB):    $0.15/GB/month
Builds (excess):         $0.01/minute

For small project (30GB storage + 100GB bandwidth):
= (30GB × $0.023) + (100GB × $0.15)
= $0.69 + $15
= ~$15.70/month
```

## **OPTION 2: AWS CloudFront + S3**

### **What is it?**
CloudFront (CDN) + S3 (static file storage) = Manual hosting

### **How it works:**
```
You build React app locally
         ↓
Get dist/ folder
         ↓
Upload to S3 bucket
         ↓
CloudFront caches & serves globally
         ↓
Your app goes live
```

### **Setup Process:**
```
1. Create S3 bucket
2. Enable static website hosting
3. Upload dist/ folder
4. Create CloudFront distribution
5. Configure S3 origin
6. Point domain to CloudFront
7. Set up HTTPS certificate
8. Create CI/CD pipeline (external tool)
Time: 2-3 hours
```

### **Pricing:**

| Item | Amount | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| S3 Storage | 5GB/month | $0 (free tier) |
| S3 requests | 20,000/month | $0 (free tier) |
| CloudFront bandwidth | 50GB/month | $0 (free tier) |
| CloudFront requests | 2M/month | $0 (free tier) |
| **TOTAL (free tier)** | - | **$0/month** |

**After free tier:**
```
S3 Storage:              $0.023/GB/month
S3 GET requests:         $0.0004 per 1000
CloudFront bandwidth:    $0.085/GB (varies by region)
CloudFront requests:     $0.0075 per 10k GET

For small project (5GB storage + 100GB bandwidth + 1M requests):
= ($0.023 × 5) + ($0.0004 × 100) + ($0.085 × 100) + ($0.0075 × 100)
= $0.115 + $0.04 + $8.50 + $0.75
= ~$9.40/month
```

### **Features:**

✅ **Static hosting**

   npm run build
   
2. Get dist/ folder with all files
   
3. Upload to S3:
   aws s3 sync dist/ s3://debate-arena-app
   
4. CloudFront serves it globally
   
5. Live at: https://d123abc.cloudfront.net
   OR your custom domain
   
6. Next update:

## **OPTION 3: AWS AppRunner**

### **What is it?**
Simplified container deployment (middle ground between Beanstalk and Lambda)

### **How it works:**
```
You create Docker image
           ↓
Push to AWS ECR (container registry)
           ↓
AppRunner pulls image
           ↓
Deploys container
           ↓
Auto-scaling handles traffic
           ↓
Your app goes live
```

### **Setup Process:**
```
1. Create Dockerfile for Spring Boot
2. Build Docker image
3. Push to AWS ECR
4. Go to AppRunner console
5. Select ECR image
6. Configure environment variables
7. Deploy!
Time: 1-2 hours (requires Docker knowledge)
```

### **Pricing:**

| Item | Amount | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| vCPU (0.25) | Per hour | $0.015/hour |
| Memory (0.5GB) | Per hour | $0.007/hour |
| Requests | Per request | $0.000001 per request |
| Data transfer | Per GB | $0.01/GB |
| **TOTAL (typical)** | - | **~$10-50/month** |

**NO free tier (unlike Beanstalk and EC2)**

```
Typical small setup:
0.25 vCPU:   $0.015 × 730 hours = $11/month
0.5GB RAM:   $0.007 × 730 hours = $5/month
Requests:    1M requests = $1/month
Data:        100GB = $1/month
──────────────────────────────────
Total:       ~$18/month

Medium setup:
0.5 vCPU:    $0.030 × 730 = $22/month
1GB RAM:     $0.014 × 730 = $10/month
Requests:    5M = $5/month
Data:        500GB = $5/month
──────────────────────────────────
Total:       ~$42/month
```

### **Features:**

✅ **Container-based**
- Docker support
- Modern approach
- Easy to version

✅ **Auto-scaling**
- Scales automatically
- Concurrency-based scaling
- No configuration needed

✅ **Simple deployment**
- Select image → deploy
- No infrastructure setup

**Cons:**
❌ No free tier (expensive!)
❌ Requires Docker knowledge
❌ Requires ECR setup
❌ Overkill for simple apps
❌ Less mature than Beanstalk
❌ Spring Boot not native (needs container)
❌ More expensive than Beanstalk

### **Who should use it:**
- ✅ Already using Docker
- ✅ Container-first architecture
- ✅ Microservices
- ❌ NOT recommended for simple Spring Boot
- ❌ NOT recommended for startups
- ❌ NOT cost-effective for your needs

### **Verdict on AppRunner:**
**Not recommended** - Beanstalk is better for Spring Boot, cheaper, and has free tier.

---

## **OPTION 4: AWS Lambda** (Serverless)

### **What is it?**
Event-driven serverless functions (pay-per-execution, no servers)

### **How it works:**
```
HTTP request arrives
           ↓
Lambda starts function
           ↓
Runs your code
           ↓
Returns response
           ↓
Stops automatically
```

### **Setup Process:**
```
1. Package Spring Boot or use Lambda container
2. Create Lambda function
3. Configure memory
4. Set environment variables
5. Attach API Gateway (for HTTP)
6. Deploy!
Time: 30 minutes (if experienced)
```

### **Pricing:**

| Item | Amount | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Requests | 1M/month | $0 (free tier) |
| Compute | 400,000 GB-seconds/month | $0 (free tier) |
| Duration (128MB) | Per 100ms | $0.0000002 |
| **TOTAL (free)** | - | **$0/month** |

**After free tier:**
```
1M requests:           $0.20
1GB compute-seconds:   $0.0000166
Typical small app:     $0-5/month

But Spring Boot has issues:
- Cold start: 5-15 seconds (users wait!)
- Memory minimum: 128MB (Spring Boot needs ~200MB)
- Timeout: 15 minutes max (not ideal)
- Container overhead: Not efficient
```

### **Features:**

✅ **Pay-per-use**
- Only pay for execution time
- No servers running
- Ultra-cheap for low traffic

✅ **Auto-scaling**
- Infinite scaling
- No configuration

**Major Cons:**
❌ **Cold start problem**
  - First request: 5-15 second delay!
  - Users experience slow app
  - Poor for continuous traffic
❌ **Spring Boot not ideal**
  - Heavy framework
  - Large JAR (~50MB)
  - Memory overhead
❌ **15-minute timeout**
  - Can't run long tasks
❌ **HTTP APIs need API Gateway**
  - Extra configuration
  - Extra cost
❌ **Not suitable for continuous services**
  - Designed for event-driven
  - Not REST API servers

### **Why NOT Lambda for your backend:**

Your app needs:
- ❌ Fast response (Lambda = 5-15s cold start)
- ❌ Continuous running (Lambda = event-driven)
- ❌ Database connections (pooling not available)
- ❌ Session management (Lambda = stateless)
- ❌ File uploads (timeout issues)

**Verdict: Lambda is completely unsuitable for your Spring Boot backend.**
